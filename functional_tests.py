# # to check out its homepage
# browser.get(r'http://localhost:8000')

# # She notices the page title and header mention to-do lists
# assert 'To-Do' in browser.title

# # She is invited to enter a to-do item strainght away

# # She types "Buy peacock feathers" into a text box (Edith's hobby
# # is tying fly-fishing lures)

# # When she hits enter, the page updates, and now the page lists
# # "1: Buy peacock feathers" as an item in a to-do list

# # There is still a text box inviting her to add another item. She
# # enters "Use peacock feathers to make a fly" (Edith is very methodical)

# # The page updates again, and now shows both items on her list

# # Edith wonders whether the site will remember her list. Then she sees
# # that the site has generated a unique URL for her -- there is some
# # explanatory text to that effect.

# # She visits that URL - her to-do list is still there.

# # Satisfied, she goes back to sleep.
